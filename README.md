- **Integrate with Kommunicate**  
  Sign up at [Kommunicate](https://www.kommunicate.io/), then connect your Dialogflow agent through the Kommunicate dashboard.  

- **Deploy on Your Website**  
  Copy the Kommunicate chat widget script and paste it into your websiteâ€™s HTML to embed the chatbot.
